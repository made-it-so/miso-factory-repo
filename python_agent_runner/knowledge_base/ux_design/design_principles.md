# MISO Core Design Principles

1.  **Visibility of System Status:** The user should always be informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable time.
2.  **Match Between System and the Real World:** The system should speak the user's language, with words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms.
3.  **User Control and Freedom:** Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.
4.  **Consistency and Standards:** Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.
5.  **Error Prevention:** Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place.
6.  **Recognition Rather Than Recall:** Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible.
7.  **Flexibility and Efficiency of Use:** Accelerators—unseen by the novice user—may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users.
8.  **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design:** Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed.

    "Title: Enhancing MISO's Code Generation and Refactoring Capabilities with AI-Powered Software Engineering Tools, titled ": "MISO can leverage the findings from this paper to develop more effective AI-powered software engineering tools that improve code generation and refactoring capabilities. By integrating transformer-based architectures and Gemini-2.5-Pro models, MISO can enhance its ability to generate high-quality code and refactor existing codebases efficiently. Additionally, by incorporating long-context scoring systems, MISO can further improve the accuracy of its generated code and reduce errors. This would enable MISO to provide more reliable and maintainable software engineering services, ultimately improving development efficiency and reducing costs."
